This is my first mod to be released, but it's also the second mod I've worked on. It might not be the best, but hey, everyone's gotta start somewhere, right? A lot of my writing comes from Witcover - I've closely paraphrased some of what he's said, and even taken Biden quotes directly from him. It's a shame I can't write Bidenisms well. I at least hope the writing was satisfactory.</p><p>I would like to give special thanks to the Campaign Trail Discord Community - if you haven't joined, I don't blame you, but the people there have been a great help in getting me to achieve my modding dreams.</p><p>A very special thanks goes out to CatBoxXD, who graciously allowed me to use their Delaware map.</p>","has_visits":0,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":10,"year":1976,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"IL01-2000"}];e.credits = "theanswerisme";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":15,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":91,"fields":{"first_name":"Barack","last_name":"Obama","election":10,"party":"Democratic","state":"Hyde Park","priority":1,"description":"Barack Hussein Obama was warned against this.

Bobby Rush leads you… but it’s much closer than even you or your staff were expecting. You feel something in your spine, something like electricity. The gap between you and Rush keeps narrowing and then… you are in the lead. A smile starts to creep onto your lips. You turn to Michelle, who is beginning to grin, too.<br><br>''Barack, honey, I think you did it,'' she says. ''There’s still 10% of the vote to be counted,'' you reply quickly. You won’t let yourself feel the sheer joy of victory yet; you have to be sure they can’t take this away from you.<br><br>Soon the TV declares, ''We can now report that Barack Obama has defeated Congressman Rush and will be heading into the general election as the Democratic nominee.'' The small crowd of allies in your room breaks into rapturous cheers and whoops. You’ve done it; you’ve really done it.<br><br>After a few minutes of celebration, your campaign manager, Dan Shomon, comes in holding a cell phone. ''Barack, it’s the Congressman,'' he says. You walk toward him, take the phone, and hush the joyous staff and friends in the room.<br><br>Though the room is quiet, you barely hear Rush. Your mind is swirling. Still, you make an effort to be courteous. ''I want to meet with you and your team, Bobby,'' you hear yourself say. ''I’ve always known there’s a lot we can learn from the great work you’ve done.''<br><br>Eventually, after what feels like a night of celebration, a beer or two, and plenty of smiles and wide eyes, you head back to your Hyde Park home with your wife and daughter. You’ve tried to keep your cool, but you still feel like you’re vibrating. Just a few minutes after you walk in, you hear your cell phone buzzing. You answer. It’s the President. ''Barack, congratulations. I look forward to working with you,'' a familiar Southern voice says. ''Thank you, sir,'' you say.</p>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>RUSH DEFEATS OBAMA IN SOUTH SIDE SHOWDOWN</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><p>As you watch the results trickle in, you quickly realize you aren’t going to win.
